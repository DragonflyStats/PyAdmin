#### Notes
* Internation Trans Day of Visibility was marked on Friday 31st March. Trans*code held a hackathon in London.

* Trans*code aims to help draw attention to transgender issues through a topic focused hackday while introductory programming workshops allow for participation from community members not currently working in technology. 
This is only the second event in Europe.

* I previously had contact with Naomi Ceder [Twitter: @NaomiCeder], one of Trans_Code Founder, and also a PSF board member.

* The Hackathon was organized by Kayleigh Bateman [Twitter: @JournoKayleigh] who works for "WeAreTechWomen" [Twitter: @WATC_WeAreTech], a component of "We Are the City", a London Business association.

* On Thursday 30th March, there was a brainstorming/networking session at a startup incubator. It was pretty low-key. The attendance was 15-20 approximately.

* On Friday 31st March, the TDOV Hackathon took place at Cap Gemini's Office in Holborn (worth noting, the venue host is Tricia Driver [@TriciaDriver] ).
