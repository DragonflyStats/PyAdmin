The labeling of parts as "defective" or "nondefective" is an example of
  ?    ordinal data
  ?    ratio data
  ?    interval data
:-)  nominal data
The level of measurement that is simply a label for the purpose of identifying an item is
  ?    ordinal measurement
  ?    ratio measurement
  ?    nominal Measurement
  ?    none of the above

The level of measurement that allows for the rank ordering of data items is
  1)    nominal measurement
