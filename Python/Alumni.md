On behalf of Python Ireland, we would like to invite you to submit a new workshop or talk proposal for the PyCon Ireland annual conference this year on Saturday 21st and Sunday 22nd October 2017 in the Radisson Blu Royal Hotel in Dublin.

This yearâ€™s conference consists of two tracks of talks along with two tracks of workshops. Python Ireland are looking for talks from all fields of application as long as they are strongly related to python and its use, including Data Science and Data Engineering.

We believe that the Irish Tech Community would be very well placed to make an engaging contribution to what promises to be our most exciting conference yet.

The conference, fully volunteer organized is only possible with the help of people from the community stepping forward to share their time and knowledge.

The Python Ireland Committee
