### Python Ireland's Twitter Feed

The Python Ireland twitter feed is operating fairly efficiently. 
It is a key tool in informing the public about our calls for speakers, promoting ticket sales, calls for sponsorship etc etc.
We have a system of pre-scheduling tweets (CFPs, Youtube videos, etc) which tweet consistently throughout the year.

***Proposed Action:*** 
* None specifically for operating the twitter account, but other recommendations would have relevance to its operation.


### Python Ireland's Facebook Page

* Tweets authored by Python Ireland are relayed to our Facebook page.
* We have 230 followers on our FB page. Each tweet typically generates 30-50 impressions.
* We should aim to improve on this over the course of the year.
* In August 2017, we boosted a post about the CFP. We reached 5400 people at a cost of 17 Euro. 
       (*I think this was a successful strategy, and a satisfactory return on investment.*)

***Proposed Action:***
* Have more FB page admins. 
* Admins collate more information about European PyCons and PyData Conferfences.
* Have pre-scheduled FB posts related to Python (not Relays from Twitter).
* More high-quality content. Suitable content on twitter does not equate to suitable content on FB.
* Boost posts on an ongoing basis in the lead up to PyCon Ireland. (i.e. 4 boosted posts at a cost of 20 euro each)
       (*We should also boost posts related to regional events, but we should consider that a separate matter*)

### Python Ireland's LinkedIn Group
* I propose to use Linkedin more actively for outreach and promotion.
* LinkedIn has a very impressive impression rate, but harder to automate processes.

***Proposed Action:***
* Volunteers to come forward to act as moderators/Admins

### Irish Tech Community Slack

*** Proposed Action:***
* The committee all join, and be a bit more active in promoting Python Ireland.
