### Overview: 
* PyCon Ireland 2016 takes place in the Radisson Blu Hotel in Dublin City Centre and consists of two days of talks, tutorials and workshops.  
* Our objective was to encourage more women and members of minority groups to attend PyCon Ireland, and subsequently to engage more with the Python Community. 
* We used part of this grant to distribute 20 complementary tickets.
* The remaining part of the grant was allocated to the Financial Aid fund.


### Grant Size: 
* USD $3,200.00  (i.e. €2,866.74 EUR)
* This grant will be divided as follows:
       *  $2000 approx (€1800) for 20 complementary tickets.
       * (Specifically €90 Euro towards the cost of each of the 20 tickets.)
* $1200 approx (€1000) for financial aid.

### Details on complementary tickets 
 * The total cost per person is €114.48 (USD $128 approx).
 * This figure is based on two key costs: venue rental costs (fixed) and catering costs (variable).
 * The total rental cost is €12700 (USD $14167.28). Based on 330 attendees, this is €38.48 Euro per attendee (USD $43 approx).
 * The catering cost per attendee for two days is €76 per person (USD $85 approx).

### Details on financial aid
 * We used existing funds for this scheme, in addition to any grant funds received.
 * We shall allocate grants of approximatley €150 to applicants from the Island of Ireland. 
 * A minimum of 50% of the financial aid budget will be spent this way.
 * We shall also allocate grants of approximately €300 to applicants from the European Union. 
 * Should there be any surplus funds in the financial aid scheme after the application deadline, the surplus funds would be used to fund more complementary tickets.
