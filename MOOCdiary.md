####Intro to Big Data
Cloud computing ( on demand computing) is one of the ways in which computing has now become 
something that we can do anytime, and anywhere. 

This new ability, combined with our torrent of data, gives us the opportunity to perform novel, 
dynamic and scalable data analysis, to tell us new things about our world and ourself. 
To summarize, a new torrent of big data combined with computing capability anytime, 
anywhere has been at the core of the  launch of the big data era.
