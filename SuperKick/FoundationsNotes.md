Document Databases
Instead of storing data in rows and columns in a table, data is stored in documents, and these documents are grouped together in collections. Each document can have a completely different structure. Document databases include the aforementioned CouchDB and MongoDB.

Key-Value Stores

Data is stored in an associative array of key-value pairs. The key is an attribute name, which is linked to a value. Well-known key value stores include Redis, Voldemort (developed by LinkedIn) and Dynamo (developed by Amazon).

Graph Databases

Used for data whose relations are represented well in a graph. Data is stored in graph structures with nodes (entities), properties (information about the entities) and lines (connections between the entities). Examples of this type of database include Neo4J and InfiniteGraph.

Columnar (or Wide-Column) Databases

Instead of ‘tables’, in columnar databases you have column families, which are containers for rows. Unlike RDBMS, you don’t need to know all of the columns up front, each row doesn’t have to have the same number of columns. Columnar databases are best suited to analysing huge datasets- big names include Cassandra and HBase.
