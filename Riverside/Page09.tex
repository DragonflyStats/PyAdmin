A sampling statistic from a SRS has a predictable patter of values in repeated samples. This pattern is called a sampling distributions

\subsection*{Notes on Sampling}

\begin{itemize}

\item Values of statistics from an SRS have a known distribution in repeated sampling.

\item When the sampling frame list the entore population, simple random sampling produces unbiased estimates

\item The precision of a statistic from an SRS depends on the size of the sample

\end{itemize}

A sample statistic is unbiased if, on average over many samples, the statistic is a correct estimate of the population parameter of intersest.
