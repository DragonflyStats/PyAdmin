The talking points could be:

-Introduction searching information from multiples sources with OSINT tools.
-OSINT tools developed with python for extracting public information from servers and domains.
-Advantages and limitations these tools from the user point of view.
-Comment how these tools are developed and the main modules used in their development.

Some of the tools to comment are:

Shodan Python API as search engine server information.
Tinfoleak and Tweepy as Python scripts for data extraction on twitter.
SpiderFoot as a tool for extract information from multiple sources.
the Harvester as Python script for extracting emails and hostnames in a particular domain."	Intermediate	A detailed look at a niche area of Python., A detailed look at a niche library/technology.	45 - 50 Mins		laptop

Some of the most powerful tools for extracting the data in web pages can be found in python ecosystem.

1.Introduction to webscraping and python tools

Some of the most powerful tools to extract data can be found in the python ecosystem, among which we highlight Beautiful soup, Pyquery and Scrapy.


2.Asyncio with aiohttp for asyncronous requests

I will make an introduction to asyncio and aiohttp modules explaining the basic concepts like coroutines and event loops and try to compare them with requests module. The most important is understand why the union asyncio + aiohttp has a better performance than requests module.

3.Asynchronous scraping data

I will show an example integrating some of the scraping tools commented before like BeautifulSoup or Scrapy with asyncio + aiohttp and obtain the performance improvement comparing with Requests module.
