I explain how Kivy works, describe my build environment and development process, and explain the technical details of a few demos. I will talk about the strengths and weaknesses of this technology, and tackle a few common questions regarding compatibility and performance.

Kivy is a remarkable project that has very little literature about it. Hopefully, my talk will raise the awareness of the Python community and convince developers to try it out."	Intermediate	A detailed look at a niche library/technology.	45 - 50 Mins	No	Just a laptop

However, research has shown that the main benefits of code reviews are; knowledge transfer, team awareness and finding alternative solutions.

Code reviews when done well are more than just finding defects; it should be a discussion and conversation with other developers about finding the best solutions. We will talk about re-framing code review to encourage open discussions.

This talk is for everyone that is already involved in regular code review and those hoping to start.

I've used Python a lot, for several years	I have spoken twice at PyCon US and at several smaller regional Python conferences (PyGotham in NYC, and PyOhio).	https://late.am/	Python Data Science	Demystifying Logistic Regression	Data science	"What is Logistic Regression? (3 min)
- Statistical machine learning technique that predicts probabilities of a true/false outcome
- We use past “examples”, along with their outcome, to predict the future. Each example is decomposed into “features”, facts about the example
- For this talk, we’ll try to predict the likelihood of a talk being accepted to US PyCon (each submission is an example) using features like length of the submission, talk length, number of past acceptances, number of talks at other conferences (as detailed in talk proposal)

LR in brief (5 min)
- Prediction is the sum of products. Each product is a learned weight associated with a feature times the value of the feature. Result is “squashed” using logistic function (hence the name) to produce a value between 0 and 1.
- Learning process begins with no knowledge, and learns the weight for each feature
- This is called “stochastic gradient descent”. It’s not as scary as it sounds.

A Simplistic Implementation (7 min)
- Prediction function takes in an example, extracts its features, multiplies features by weights, and squashes results.
- Weights are maintained in a dictionary -- each feature has its own learned weight
- SGD training predicts using current weights, compares the prediction to the recorded outcome, and adjust weights

Categorical features (5 min)
- A categorical feature is a feature that doesn’t have a numeric value, like “is the submission about testing?”
- LR handles categorical features by implicitly generating features whose value is either 0 or 1, like “testing:1” if the talk is about testing
- Since the feature value is multiplied by the weight, if the talk is about web programming, the feature becomes “testing:0” -- we say the feature is absent in this example

Feature Engineering (5 min)
- An important part of LR or any machine learning endeavor is creating and training on the right features
- This is where humans assist the machine learning algorithm. We apply our knowledge of the problem domain by generating features that might not be obviously present
- For PyCon talk submissions, I use engineered features like: “does the submission contain timings in the outline?” (categorical) and “average length of sentences in talk submission” (continuous)

Training vs. Testing (5 min)
- “Over-fitting” is a problem in machine learning, especially if you have a relatively small (less than thousands?) training data set
- Solution is simple: hold out 10% (or maybe more) of examples from the training data set, and use these only to evaluate the quality of your model
- When the performance on the testing set is sufficiently good (or when the improvement in performance begins to level off), call it a day and use that model

Training Regimen (10 min)
- These are “hyper-parameters” of the model -- the control how the model is built, rather than how the examples are collected or features constructed
- Learning rate: how quickly does the model learn from each new example
- Learning passes: how many times do we train on each example
- With multiple passes, how do you know when you’ve made enough passes?
- Regularization: how do we decrease the importance of infrequently-seen features (those in which we have less confidence, because we have less data about them)
- Feature interactions: what impact does the presence of two features together have on the outcome?

Results: (3 min)····
- TBD, I don’t have this data set and haven’t trained a model yet!

He started using Nix and later NixOS (linux distribution built around Nix) 5 years ago. Previously he worked at RhodeCode, where he introduced Nix as a packaging tool for RhodeCode's installer. Currently he is working at Mozilla as Release Engineer.	I've used Python a lot, for several years	No	https://twitter.com/garbas	Package management	Rethinking package management	python packaging and packaging in general	"Packaging is a hard problem. Still every language/distribution tries to invent packaging on their own. This leaves us (developers / sysadmins) with a big number of tools that we need to master in order to do our job. We will look at how Nix[1] and NixOS[2] can be used in today's software development processes and which are the benefits and drawbacks you might face.

In this talk we will look into how Nix can be used to solve some problems we face when developing with python and how it might just be the right tool for your next project.

[1] Nix is a powerful package manager for Linux and other Unix systems that makes package management reliable and reproducible. It provides atomic upgrades and rollbacks, side-by-side installation of multiple versions of a package, multi-user package management and easy setup of build environments.

[2] NixOS is a Linux distribution built on top of the Nix package manager, it is completely declarative, makes upgrading systems reliable, and has many other advantages.

By day I am a Team lead and Senior Software engineer. As part of this I enjoy leading a multinational team using Python to deliver a wide range of business functionality.

Initially I entered the world of Control Systems and Robotics with a BE in Robotic Engineering. However I fast discovered Software Engineering through the Computer Society, helping to organize and run several Open Source conferences.

Ever since I've been hooked, enjoying working in and leading a team to produce the best, most robust software. I especially enjoy working in functional & immutable languages such as Erlang and Clojure.

I maintain a blog, github and twitter account.

Object-relational mappers (ORM) have somewhat of a bad reputation. SQLAlchemy is not just an ORM, but gives you an entire toolkit to aid you in working with any SQL relational database.

In this talk I will give an introduction and deep dive into the 2 main sections of the library, the expression language and the ORM. And outline some of the more powerful features available at your fingertips.

I have used SQLAlchemy extensively for over 3 years now. Creating a full domain model using it's declarative mappings. Constructing optimized queries and custom SQL statements and built a self-optimizing domain specific language (DSL) for a fully-fledged REST API.
I hope to impart some of the tips, tricks and ways of working that I have gained over this time."	Intermediate	An introduction into a commonly used third-party technology.
