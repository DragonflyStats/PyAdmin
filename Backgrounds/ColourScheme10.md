We will start with writing a basic interpreter for an easily parseable language, converting it into stack machine instructions. We will also write a very basic stack machine. After that we will start playing with CPython dis module to see how it works. We will implement a basic stack machine for python instructions. Code of CPython will be read and various objects-functions will be played with"	Intermediate	An introduction into some commonly used parts of Python.
