In the last few years, a number of startups such as Clarifai and Indico, and much bigger players such as Google and Microsoft, have launched their own 'machine learning as a service' offerings, including 'vision' products that can recognise objects present in image and video footage and automatically tag them, provide optical character recognition (OCR) services, and even not safe for work (NSFW) classifiers that can be used to omit content from internal networks.

This talk will focus on 'food' recognition within images, and will walk through the basics of how to get started with image classification, from using APIs and SDKs for some of the commercial (but free) offerings available, to trying and recreate those services locally, first by walking through and example of the 'bag of features' technique, using a mix of supervised and unsupervised methods in scikit-learn and OpenCV, and secondly showing examples based on 'transfer learning', a 'deep learning' technique to reuse pre-trained convolutional neural networks to customise classification from smaller training datasets."

One of these is the detection of duplicate product records within the platform, where different tenants input the same product using different product descriptions. Commonly referred to as the *Record Linkage* problem in Machine Learning, the task is to group together similar product records under a single canonical identifier, which is useful for business intelligence purposes and for product search etc. The kernel of the solution is the computation of an ~O(n**2) all-pairs similarity join, where the runtime explodes quadratically with an increase in input.

At Zalando's Fashion Insight Centre in Dublin we are looking at solutions to this problem that work at scale (i.e., more than one million products). For our particular problem, which involves Categorical Data (cosine similarity will not work here), we employ a data-driven similarity measure and approximate the similarity join using a two-step approach. In this talk we introduce the standard approaches to the problem and illustrate our work-to-date using Python."

Various approaches are made to handle this issue, the simplest of which is to add standard errors around point forecasts. This approach requires strong underlying assumptions for the data.

Better methods involve bootstrapping the data and running multiple instances of the modelling on each bootstrap sample and estimating the uncertainty that way. An alternative approach is to take a Bayesian approach and use Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) to sample of the posterior distribution conditioned on the data. Often computationally expensive MCMC tool have begun introducing a related optimisation-based approach known as Automatic Differentiation Variational Inference (ADVI).

In this talk I will introduce and compare the three approaches in a three cases: a simple 'flat' linear model, a poisson process and a hierarchical model (the 8 schools dataset).

In all cases we will compare the outputs of the various approaches and attempt to benchmark performance of the algorithms in terms of simplicity, execution speed, memory usage and prediction. We also assess how effective the various approaches are at capturing the uncertainty in the modelling process.

The talk is likely to include both R and Python code as well as the use of Stan for MCMC sampling and ADVI.

"	@ianhuston	General Data Science	How Data Science fits in the Balanced Team	Data Science	"The goal of a Balanced Team is to share ownership and responsibility for the success of a project between team members. Each team member has specific obligations to the team and a specific area of authority. Until recently, designers, product managers and developers were the usual team members considered. In this talk I will explore how data scientists can function in a balanced team and discuss my experience working as a data scientist on balanced teams at Pivotal Labs with our global clients. I will consider what obligations and authority a data scientist can provide as part of a balanced team and how this situation differs from the usual jack-of-all-trades type data science work.

I will outline specific examples where data science can help user centric design and product management, and where the practices of lean-startup and agile development can help accelerate analysis and data science. Based on my experience building data science driven products with a global bank and European car manufacturers, I will outline what we tried, what worked and most importantly what didn’t.

If you are a data scientist or need to work with one, this talk will equip you to understand how data science can be an integral part of a balanced team.

Python Exception Handling	Everyone agrees that writing code in Python is easier than most other programming languages. It's easy to knock-up something quickly to solve most problems, which is great if all your code is "throw-away". Python's great at not getting in your way: you write your code, it runs, then you move onto something else. But, how easy is to to write robust code in Python, that is: code which has to hang around for a long time? What if you need to write code which not only runs but also has to handle problems should they occur?

I've used Python a lot, for several years	I have given hundreds of conference and workshop presentations. At PyConIE, I have presented at least one talk or workshop each of the past two years.	https://github.com/mmckerns	Python Data Science	Using the mystic framework to accelerate data science	data science, numerical optimization, and parallel computing	"In business analytics, operations research, engineering design, and other predictive sciences, a critical step in building models of reality and making predictions is solving an optimization problem.  Reality is high-dimensional, nonlinear, and often probabilistic -- while optimizers are typically at best either nonlinear or high-dimensional, and rarely are probabilistic. Thus, we are often forced to solve reduced-dimensional problems that may no longer adequately represent reality. This talk will introduce some new tools for solving high-dimensional non-convex optimization problems with nonlinear constraints.

In this talk I’ll begin with traditional optimization methods, then show how to extend these methods to solve high-dimensional non-convex optimization problems with highly nonlinear constraints using the mystic framework.

I’ll start by introducing the cost function, and it’s use in local and global optimization. I’ll then address how to monitor and diagnose optimization convergence and results, tune an optimizer, and customize optimizer stop conditions. Traditionally, optimizers have been limited in their ability to apply constraining information, in that certain algorithms provide box constraints while others provide built-in penalty functions. Very often when constraints can be applied, they are limited to either quadratic or linear constraints.  I’ll discuss how to build robust penalty functions and symbolic constraints equations, and demonstrate new methods to efficiently reduce optimizer search space. I’ll also discuss how to apply statistical and probabilistic constraints.

Real-world inverse problems are expensive, thus I’ll show several ways to accelerate optimization through asynchronous and parallel computing. This talk will demonstrate how efficiency in optimization workflow can be dramatically increased by solver restarts, saving of state, results caching and archiving, and automated dimensional reduction. Next I will discuss new hyper-optimization methods that leverage parallel computing to perform fast global optimizations and n-dimensional global searches. Can your favorite optimizer discover all local extrema on an unknown potential energy surface in a single invocation? mystic can.

The audience need not be an expert in optimization, but should have interest in solving hard real-world optimization problems.  The audience should walk away with a working knowledge of how to use modern constrained optimization tools, how to enable their solvers to leverage high-performance parallel computing, and how to utilize legacy data and surrogate models in statistical and predictive modeling.
