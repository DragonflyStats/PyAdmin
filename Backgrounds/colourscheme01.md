I've used Python a lot, for several years	I have spoken twice at PyCon US and at several smaller regional Python conferences (PyGotham in NYC, and PyOhio).	https://late.am/	Python Data Science	Demystifying Logistic Regression	Data science	"What is Logistic Regression? (3 min)
- Statistical machine learning technique that predicts probabilities of a true/false outcome
- We use past “examples”, along with their outcome, to predict the future. Each example is decomposed into “features”, facts about the example
- For this talk, we’ll try to predict the likelihood of a talk being accepted to US PyCon (each submission is an example) using features like length of the submission, talk length, number of past acceptances, number of talks at other conferences (as detailed in talk proposal)

LR in brief (5 min)
- Prediction is the sum of products. Each product is a learned weight associated with a feature times the value of the feature. Result is “squashed” using logistic function (hence the name) to produce a value between 0 and 1.
- Learning process begins with no knowledge, and learns the weight for each feature
- This is called “stochastic gradient descent”. It’s not as scary as it sounds.

A Simplistic Implementation (7 min)
- Prediction function takes in an example, extracts its features, multiplies features by weights, and squashes results.
- Weights are maintained in a dictionary -- each feature has its own learned weight
- SGD training predicts using current weights, compares the prediction to the recorded outcome, and adjust weights

Categorical features (5 min)
- A categorical feature is a feature that doesn’t have a numeric value, like “is the submission about testing?”
- LR handles categorical features by implicitly generating features whose value is either 0 or 1, like “testing:1” if the talk is about testing
- Since the feature value is multiplied by the weight, if the talk is about web programming, the feature becomes “testing:0” -- we say the feature is absent in this example

Feature Engineering (5 min)
- An important part of LR or any machine learning endeavor is creating and training on the right features
- This is where humans assist the machine learning algorithm. We apply our knowledge of the problem domain by generating features that might not be obviously present
- For PyCon talk submissions, I use engineered features like: “does the submission contain timings in the outline?” (categorical) and “average length of sentences in talk submission” (continuous)

Training vs. Testing (5 min)
- “Over-fitting” is a problem in machine learning, especially if you have a relatively small (less than thousands?) training data set
- Solution is simple: hold out 10% (or maybe more) of examples from the training data set, and use these only to evaluate the quality of your model
- When the performance on the testing set is sufficiently good (or when the improvement in performance begins to level off), call it a day and use that model

Training Regimen (10 min)
- These are “hyper-parameters” of the model -- the control how the model is built, rather than how the examples are collected or features constructed
- Learning rate: how quickly does the model learn from each new example
- Learning passes: how many times do we train on each example
- With multiple passes, how do you know when you’ve made enough passes?
- Regularization: how do we decrease the importance of infrequently-seen features (those in which we have less confidence, because we have less data about them)
- Feature interactions: what impact does the presence of two features together have on the outcome?

Results: (3 min)····
- TBD, I don’t have this data set and haven’t trained a model yet!

Still every language/distribution tries to invent packaging on their own. This leaves us (developers / sysadmins) with a big number of tools that we need to master in order to do our job. We will look at how Nix[1] and NixOS[2] can be used in today's software development processes and which are the benefits and drawbacks you might face.

In this talk we will look into how Nix can be used to solve some problems we face when developing with python and how it might just be the right tool for your next project.

[1] Nix is a powerful package manager for Linux and other Unix systems that makes package management reliable and reproducible. It provides atomic upgrades and rollbacks, side-by-side installation of multiple versions of a package, multi-user package management and easy setup of build environments.

[2] NixOS is a Linux distribution built on top of the Nix package manager, it is completely declarative, makes upgrading systems reliable, and has many other advantages.

## Subtitle
Manage Kubernetes with Python using the open source, pythononic API wrapper we developed called Kube

## Duration
30 minutes.

## Description
Kubernetes is the Google Borg inspired control plane for Docker containers that everyone is talking about.  It has a great API but needs a load of HTTP client code and JSON processing to use it from Python.  This talk introduces Kube, a Python wrapper around the Kubernetes API that enables you to manage your Kubernetes cluster in a pythonic way while avoiding any Kubernetes API peculiarities.

## Audience
Programmers and operations folk who are interested in interacting with the Kubernetes API using Python, whether it's to help create a software defined infrastructure, monitor the behaviour of their cluster or just for fun.

## Level
Intermediate

## Prerequisites
A reasonable handle of Python, iterators, context managers etc; understanding of Kubernetes concepts and the need to manage K8s programmatically.

## Objectives
Attendees will learn about the key concepts in getting resource information out of their Kubernetes cluster using Kube; how to create, view, update and destroy resources and how to respond to 'watch' events that signify that a resource's state has changed.

## Detailed Abstract
Docker has had a transformative influence on the way we deploy software and Kubernetes, the Google Borg inspired control plane for Docker-container-hosting-clusters, is gaining similar momentum.  Being able to easily interact with this technology from Python will become an increasingly important capability in many organisations.

In this talk I'll discuss what the motivations behind writing Kube were, provide a quick recap of Kubernetes, it's role and key concepts.  We'll then dive into Kube using the Python interactive interpreter, from getting connected to the API to some simple viewing and label update operations. Finally I'll discuss more advanced resource management activities like Kube's 'watch' API capability, creating resources and the Cluster proxy attribute for when you really need to get to the raw Kubernetes API.

## Outline
1. Setting the scene (3 minutes)
    * We are writing a monitoring SaaS product
    * We assessed the various IaaS and PaaS offerings available,
      chose GCP and GKE.
    * Needed to be able to interact with K8s programmatically for
      provisioning.
    * Also wanted to dog food, monitor our own deployment.

1. Aren't there other Python kubernetes wrappers? (2 minutes)
    * There are, at the time there were less.
    * List some and their strengths.
    * We really needed decent WATCH API support though.

1. Kubernetes concepts quick recap (5 minutes)
    * Refresher of main Kubernetes concepts.

1. Dive into Kube in the Python interactive interpreter (10 minutes)

    * Quickly outline prerequisites, pip-installation and how K8s clients
    should run inside or outside K8s itself, using ``kubectl proxy``:

        $ kubectl proxy
        Starting to serve on localhost:8001

    * The entry point - a Cluster instance:

        >>> import kube
        >>> cluster = kube.Cluster()

        - or...
        >>> cluster = kube.Cluster(url='http://localhost:8080/api')

        - or...
        >>> with kube.Cluster() as cluster:
        ...     cluster.nodes
        ...
        <NodeView>

    * Discuss Views and Items - two important Kube concepts:

        >>> cluster.nodes
        <NodeView>
        >>> cluster.replicasets
        <ReplicaSetView>
        >>> cluster.namespaces
        <NamespaceView>

    * Get a resource item - if you know what it is:

        >>> rs = cluster.replicasets.fetch('tiauth-v1', namespace='default')
        >>> rs
        <ReplicaSetItem tiauth-v1 namespace=default>

    * Good news, the view attributes are iterators!

        >>> [rs for rs in cluster.replicasets]
        [<ReplicaSetItem tiauth-v1 namespace=default>, ...]

    * Lets get one and poke around

        >>> rs = [rs for rs in cluster.replicasets][0]
        >>> rs
        <ReplicaSetItem tiauth-v1 namespace=default>

    * The meta data attribute:

        >>> rs.meta
        <kube._meta.ObjectMeta object at 0x7f6c7f9f4668>
        >>> rs.meta.name
        'auth-v1'
        >>> rs.meta.namespace
        'default'
        >>> rs.meta.labels
        <Labels ""stream=staging,svc=tiauth,portal=all,mylabel=value,v=v1"">

    * Discuss resource versions in K8s

        >>> rs.meta.version
        655487
        >>> print([node.meta.version for node in cluster.nodes])
        ['6434482', '6434483', '6434481']
        >>> # A bit later
        ...
        >>> print([node.meta.version for node in cluster.nodes])
        ['6434485', '6434486', '6434484']

    * Labels - get, set and delete.
        - What are labels? Labels are key/value pairs that are attached to
          resource objects. Identifying attributes that are meaningful
          Can be used to select subsets of objects for operations.

        - So we have a replicaset, look at its labels
        >>> rs.meta.labels
        <Labels ""svc=auth,stream=staging,portal=all,v=v1"">

        - It's a dict-like object
        >>> rs.meta.labels['svc']
        'auth'

        - Which is immutable
        >>> rs.meta.labels['svc'] = 'foobar'
        Traceback (most recent call last):
          File ""<stdin>"", line 1, in <module>
        TypeError: 'ResourceLabels' object does not support item assignment

        - You can add a label like this
        >>> rs.meta.labels.set('mylabel','foo')
        <ReplicaSetItem tiauth-v1 namespace=default>

        - The latest version of the resource item is returned for any update
          operation, this is important!  Look at rs...
        >>> rs.meta.labels
        <Labels svc=tiauth,stream=staging,portal=all,v=v1"">

        - So always get the latest version of a resource...
        >>> rs = rs.meta.labels.set('mylabel','foo2')
        >>> rs.meta.labels
        <Labels ""mylabel=foo2,svc=tiauth,stream=staging,portal=all,v=v1"">

        - Update is same
        >>> rs = rs.meta.labels.set('mylabel','foo3')
        >>> rs.meta.labels
        <Labels ""mylabel=foo3,svc=tiauth,stream=staging,portal=all,v=v1"">

        - Delete label
        >>> rs = rs.meta.labels.delete('mylabel')
        >>> rs.meta.labels
        <Labels ""svc=tiauth,portal=all,v=v1,stream=staging"">

1. More Kube features (5 minutes)
    * Creating and deleting resources
    * Using Kube's Watch API support
    * Resource View Filters
    * The cluster proxy attribute for when you need to get at the actual API

1. Q&A (5 minutes)

1. Setting the scene (3 minutes)
    * We are writing a monitoring SaaS product
    * We assessed the various IaaS and PaaS offerings available,
      chose GCP and GKE.
    * Needed to be able to interact with K8s programmatically for
      provisioning.
    * Also wanted to dog food, monitor our own deployment.

1. Aren't there other Python kubernetes wrappers? (2 minutes)
    * There are, at the time there were less.
    * List some and their strengths.
    * We really needed decent WATCH API support though.

1. Kubernetes concepts quick recap (5 minutes)
    * Refresher of main Kubernetes concepts.

1. Dive into Kube in the Python interactive interpreter (10 minutes)

    * Quickly outline prerequisites, pip-installation and how K8s clients
    should run inside or outside K8s itself, using ``kubectl proxy``:

        $ kubectl proxy
        Starting to serve on localhost:8001

    * The entry point - a Cluster instance:

        >>> import kube
        >>> cluster = kube.Cluster()

        - or...
        >>> cluster = kube.Cluster(url='http://localhost:8080/api')

        - or...
        >>> with kube.Cluster() as cluster:
        ...     cluster.nodes
        ...
        <NodeView>

    * Discuss Views and Items - two important Kube concepts:

        >>> cluster.nodes
        <NodeView>
        >>> cluster.replicasets
        <ReplicaSetView>
        >>> cluster.namespaces
        <NamespaceView>

    * Get a resource item - if you know what it is:

        >>> rs = cluster.replicasets.fetch('tiauth-v1', namespace='default')
        >>> rs
        <ReplicaSetItem tiauth-v1 namespace=default>

    * Good news, the view attributes are iterators!

        >>> [rs for rs in cluster.replicasets]
        [<ReplicaSetItem tiauth-v1 namespace=default>, ...]

    * Lets get one and poke around

        >>> rs = [rs for rs in cluster.replicasets][0]
        >>> rs
        <ReplicaSetItem tiauth-v1 namespace=default>

    * The meta data attribute:

        >>> rs.meta
        <kube._meta.ObjectMeta object at 0x7f6c7f9f4668>
        >>> rs.meta.name
        'auth-v1'
        >>> rs.meta.namespace
        'default'
        >>> rs.meta.labels
        <Labels ""stream=staging,svc=tiauth,portal=all,mylabel=value,v=v1"">

    * Discuss resource versions in K8s

        >>> rs.meta.version
        655487
        >>> print([node.meta.version for node in cluster.nodes])
        ['6434482', '6434483', '6434481']
        >>> # A bit later
        ...
        >>> print([node.meta.version for node in cluster.nodes])
        ['6434485', '6434486', '6434484']

    * Labels - get, set and delete.
        - What are labels? Labels are key/value pairs that are attached to
          resource objects. Identifying attributes that are meaningful
          Can be used to select subsets of objects for operations.

        - So we have a replicaset, look at its labels
        >>> rs.meta.labels
        <Labels ""svc=auth,stream=staging,portal=all,v=v1"">

        - It's a dict-like object
        >>> rs.meta.labels['svc']
        'auth'

        - Which is immutable
        >>> rs.meta.labels['svc'] = 'foobar'
        Traceback (most recent call last):
          File ""<stdin>"", line 1, in <module>
        TypeError: 'ResourceLabels' object does not support item assignment

        - You can add a label like this
        >>> rs.meta.labels.set('mylabel','foo')
        <ReplicaSetItem tiauth-v1 namespace=default>

        - The latest version of the resource item is returned for any update
          operation, this is important!  Look at rs...
        >>> rs.meta.labels
        <Labels svc=tiauth,stream=staging,portal=all,v=v1"">

        - So always get the latest version of a resource...
        >>> rs = rs.meta.labels.set('mylabel','foo2')
        >>> rs.meta.labels
        <Labels ""mylabel=foo2,svc=tiauth,stream=staging,portal=all,v=v1"">

        - Update is same
        >>> rs = rs.meta.labels.set('mylabel','foo3')
        >>> rs.meta.labels
        <Labels ""mylabel=foo3,svc=tiauth,stream=staging,portal=all,v=v1"">

        - Delete label
        >>> rs = rs.meta.labels.delete('mylabel')
        >>> rs.meta.labels
        <Labels ""svc=tiauth,portal=all,v=v1,stream=staging"">

- Comparison on the major template engines available in python to showcase what's special in Kajiki (validated, xml based) what was special in Genshi (also lazy evaluated)
- What's a validated template engine and why it's good to have one.
- How Kajiki works, showcase kajiki syntax, it's performances and how to use it in any python project.
- Why Kajiki is fast, code generation applied and how to write a code generation template engine like Kajiki and Jinja2 (showcase a simple 50 lines of code template engine that uses code generation)."
