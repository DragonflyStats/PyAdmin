* By day I am a Team lead and Senior Software engineer. As part of this I enjoy leading a multinational team using Python to deliver a wide range of business functionality.

* Initially I entered the world of Control Systems and Robotics with a BE in Robotic Engineering. However I fast discovered Software Engineering through the Computer Society, helping to organize and run several Open Source conferences.

* Ever since I've been hooked, enjoying working in and leading a team to produce the best, most robust software. I especially enjoy working in functional & immutable languages such as Erlang and Clojure.

* I maintain a blog, github and twitter account.
"	I've used Python a lot, for several years	Yes, both at PyCon last year and at workshops	http://david.mcilwee.me	General Python or Python based Frameworks	The power of SQLAlchemy	python, libraries, data	"The power of SQLAlchemy

* Object-relational mappers (ORM) have somewhat of a bad reputation. SQLAlchemy is not just an ORM, but gives you an entire toolkit to aid you in working with any SQL relational database.

* In this talk I will give an introduction and deep dive into the 2 main sections of the library, the expression language and the ORM. And outline some of the more powerful features available at your fingertips.

* I have used SQLAlchemy extensively for over 3 years now. Creating a full domain model using it's declarative mappings. Constructing optimized queries and custom SQL statements and built a self-optimizing domain specific language (DSL) for a fully-fledged REST API.
* I hope to impart some of the tips, tricks and ways of working that I have gained over this time."
