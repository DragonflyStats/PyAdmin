World is All surrounded by data. Machine Learning and deep learning require humongous amount of data in order to train the machine. In prototyping products, we can not waste time on generating data, and hence we fetch it by some or other means. 

Scrapping is one such way to fetch the data and make something beautiful on top of existing products. Imagine a AI based product that can recognize your clothing items and give you recommendation on where you can find the similar product. Such a case requires scrapping of websites such as Myntra, Flipkart, amazon and many more. This can yield in generating around lakhs of products and Jsons that you can use in your AI.

so, In this talk i will be talking about how to start away with making beautiful scrappers. I will talk about APIs such as requests, Beautiful soup, json. such a talk will be accompanied with the ""how to get a quickstart"" discussion, and how I used the respective module in my project.
