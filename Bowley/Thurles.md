* Variables that are based on ratio calculations (for example Diameter Ratios, and Ovality) are, 
by definion, skewed.

* The Boxplot is designed for symmetric distributions, and as such is an invalid 
approach for Skewed Data. [References Needed]

* Statistical Analyis must rely on methods that recognize the skewed nature of the data.
These methods are less commonly encountered in scientific literature.

### Bowleyâ€™s seven-figure summary
For skewed variables, Arthur Bowley proposed a set of non-parametric statistics, 
called a "seven-figure summary", including the extremes, deciles and quartiles, 
along with the median.[2]

Thus the numbers are:

1. the sample minimum
2. the 10th percentile (first decile)
3. the 25th percentile or lower quartile or first quartile
4. the 50th percentile or median (middle value, or second quartile)
5. the 75th percentile or upper quartile or third quartile
6. the 90th percentile (last decile)
7 .the sample maximum
